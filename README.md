My Spotify UI Clone 🎵
This is a new project where I recreated the look of the Spotify Web Player. I built this to practice my design skills and learn how to make professional layouts.

🛠️ How I Built It
HTML: I used this to create the "bones" of the site, like the sidebar and the music cards.

CSS: I used this for the "Dark Mode" colors and to put everything in the right spot.

Flexbox & Grid: These are the tools I used to make sure the layout looks clean and organized.

✨ What it does
Real Look: It uses the same colors and fonts as the real Spotify.

Hover Effects: When you move your mouse over a song, it lights up or shows a play button.

Clean Design: I used high-quality images of artists to make it look like a real app.

🧠 What’s Next?
Right now, this project is all about the User Interface (UI).

Finished: The design and layout.

Coming Soon: I will be adding JavaScript next to make the "Play" buttons and search bar actually work!
